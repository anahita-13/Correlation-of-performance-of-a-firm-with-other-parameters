# Correlation-of-performance-of-a-firm-with-investment-in-R&D
Run an estimation analysis to test the following hypothesis, as suggested by the professor, “All else equal, investment in R&amp;D is positively associated with firm performance”

As a research associate during my MBA, I found out that preliminary data analysis by a fellow research associate surprisingly suggested no significant correlation between the investement in R&amp;D and a firm's performance and she asked for my help to understand the result.

Firstly, I prepared a list of five questions that I would ask her to help diagnose what was happening in her study. These questions have been recorded by me in the file 'Questions.docx'. The file 'Dataset.xlsx' contains the dataset used for this problem. After clarifying these questions, she gave me her dataset for further diagnosis. The unit of observation for the data was firm-year, i.e. each row in the dataset provided data for a firm in a particular financial year. I used this data to create a variable for Tobin's Q, a metric that is widely used in strategy research to measure a firm's performance.

I created a new variable for Tobin's Q using variables in the dataset and then ran an estimation analysis to test the above mentioned hypothesis. 

In the end, I also identified if there was a possibility that the estimation may be biased due to certain issues with the sample such as the time period of the sample or the industries that firms in the sample belong to. Following this, I also ran an analysis that rectifies these potential biases and provides a more robust estimation for the hypothesis above. 

Conclusion: 
My research concluded that correlation between R&D expenditure and a firm’s performance varies significantly depending on the firm's operating industry and year of analysis. For instance, the medical, dental and hospital equipment manufacturing industry showed high correlation between R&D expenditure and performance whereas departmental stores witnessed opposite trends.
